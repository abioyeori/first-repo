# first-repo
Getting familiar with github
This is the first repository I'm creating on Github.
I've always been looking forward to using Github to host my data analysis portfolio 
but I'm confused how to go about. So, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to figure this out


I've learnt how to add a file. Now, I'm confident I can add my Jupyter notebooks and datasets
I used for analysis.

# a new dawn(section)
I just spotted how to create a new section so I'm testing it out.
